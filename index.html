                <div>
                    <p>Currently, I am a student at <a href="https://ub.edu.ph/" target="_blank">University of Batangas</a>, taking up <a href="https://ub.edu.ph/ubbc/information-and-communications-technology/" target="_blank">Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</a>. I've started properly learning programming at my 1st year of College starting from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php" target="_blank">C#</a> then to <a href="https://cplusplus.com/" target="_blank">C++</a> until the next year where I would learn Java and Java WinForms. In my 3rd year, I would learn about XML and Python. I am currently taking on training at a company to widen and improve my skillset as a web and software developer.</p>
                    <p>A lot of the time, I play games, and great margin of my games are moddable. Meaning that players who possess the capabilities to code the language that the game is capable of reading, players can enhance their experience by modifying the game and additions of their own creations such as items, monsters, allies, user interface and complex machanics that changes the gameplay a significant amount. For the better part of my life, I've made numerous amounts of video game mods and learned their the programming language those games can read. Such programming langauges Like, <a href="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Modding" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials" target="_blank">XML, C++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/doc/MODDING.md" target="_blank">JSON</a>.</p>
                    <p>I've become quite proficient with Computers, I've always helped out my siblings with their school work when it involves documents, online assignments or attending online class sessions. I taught my siblings ways around <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank">Libreoffice</a> (Microsoft Office but No licensing fees) and a Printer, which my father bought to make it easy for us.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I've have some experience with <a href="https://www.netacad.com/" target="_blank">Cisco Networking</a>, it was one of my major subjects as a college student. I've been given experience on a hands on task connecting a PC to a server via cables and terminal, which was more complicated than using Cisco's network simulator <a href="https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer" target="_blank">Cisco Packet Tracer</a>. For 2 semesters, I've come to know about configuring devices such as routers, switches, and access points via the command-line interface, routing protocols, using <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/5_x/nx-os/layer2/configuration/guide/Cisco_Nexus_7000_Series_NX-OS_Layer_2_Switching_Configuration_Guide_Release_5-x_chapter4.html" target="_blank">VLANs</a> and <a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=29803&seqNum=3" target="_blank">trunking</a> routing, Blacklist and Whitelist specific IP addresses, using <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html" target="_blank">Access Control Lists (ACLs)</a> to protect the network, troubleshoot problems regarding network or servers, and Network Services such as DHCP, DNS and NAT. </p>
                    <p>One of my experiences in my first semester in fourth year, I learned about using <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a> and its basics to its most advanced capabilities. I was first taught about the functionality and interactability of the text and button input, in which required me to provide the understanding of it. We were then tasked to make a Pizza Menu, no functionality yet, it's just to understand layout designing and utilizing tool properties. After which, in our final project. Create a fully functional Pizza menu with a backend.</p>
