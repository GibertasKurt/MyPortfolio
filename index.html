            <h1>Experiences</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Currently, I am a student at <a href="https://ub.edu.ph/" target="_blank">University of Batangas</a>, taking up <a href="https://ub.edu.ph/ubbc/information-and-communications-technology/" target="_blank">Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</a>. I've started properly learning programming at my 1st year of College starting from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php" target="_blank">C#</a> then to <a href="https://cplusplus.com/" target="_blank">C++</a> until the next year where I would learn XML, Java and Java WinForms. In my 3rd year, I would learn about Visual Basic and Python. I am currently taking on training at a company to widen and improve my skillset as a web and software developer.</p>
                <p>In my very first year in college, I was taught C++ using <a href="https://developerinsider.co/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/" target="_blank">TurboCPP</a> and Java using <a href="https://eclipseide.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse IDE</a>. Learning these helped me understand the basics of programming, including syntax, control structures, and served as a foundation of properly learning programming language via practical activities and projects.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I've have some experience with <a href="https://www.netacad.com/" target="_blank">Cisco Networking</a>, it was one of my major subjects as a college student. I've been given experience on a hands on task connecting a PC to a server via cables and terminal, which was more complicated than using Cisco's network simulator <a href="https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer" target="_blank">Cisco Packet Tracer</a>. For 2 semesters, I've come to know about configuring devices such as routers, switches, and access points via the command-line interface, routing protocols, using <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/5_x/nx-os/layer2/configuration/guide/Cisco_Nexus_7000_Series_NX-OS_Layer_2_Switching_Configuration_Guide_Release_5-x_chapter4.html" target="_blank">VLANs</a> and <a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=29803&seqNum=3" target="_blank">trunking</a> routing, Blacklist and Whitelist specific IP addresses, using <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html" target="_blank">Access Control Lists (ACLs)</a> to protect the network, troubleshoot problems regarding network or servers, and Network Services such as DHCP, DNS and NAT.</p>
                <p>For my third year, I went through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a> Academy training course, where I learned about cloud other AWS services, computing, and how to deploy and manage applications on the AWS platform. This training provided me with a good understanding in cloud technologies and through my hard work and studies, I've been given an <a href="#Header4">AWS Academy Graduate certification</a>.</p>
                <p>One of my experiences in my fourth year, I learned about using <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a> and its basics to its most advanced capabilities. I was first taught about the functionality and interactability of the text and button input, in which required me to provide the understanding of it. We were then tasked to make a Pizza Menu, no functionality yet, it's just to understand layout designing and utilizing tool properties. After which, in our final project. Create a fully functional Pizza menu with a backend.</p>
                <p>I've developed a strong proficiency with computers over the years, which has allowed me to help my siblings with their homework. Whether it's creating documents, completing online assignments, or going through online class sessions, I've been there to lend a hand. I've introduced them to <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>, a fantastic alternative to Microsoft Office that eliminates the burden of licensing fees. In addition to teaching them how to use LibreOffice, my father purchased a printer to facilitate our learning. I've shown them how to format documents for printing, troubleshoot common issues, and even manage print settings to save paper and ink.</p>
                <p>A lot of the time, I play games, and great margin of my games are moddable. Meaning that players who possess the capabilities to code the language that the game is capable of reading, players can enhance their experience by modifying the game and additions of their own creations such as items, monsters, allies, user interface and complex machanics that changes the gameplay a significant amount. For the better part of my life, I've made numerous amounts of video game mods and learned their the programming language those games can read. Such programming langauges Like, <a href="https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Modding" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials" target="_blank">XML, C++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/doc/MODDING.md" target="_blank">JSON</a>.</p>
